# Regex Data Extraction - Junior Full Stack Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the extraction of different types of data from user-provided text using Regular Expressions (Regex) in JavaScript. The web application allows users to input or paste text, and then extracts and displays:

- Email addresses  
- URLs  
- Phone numbers (various formats)  
- Credit card numbers  
- Hashtags  

The goal of this assignment is to validate and extract structured data from unstructured text using a simple, interactive web interface.
